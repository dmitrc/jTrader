jTrader

jTrader is simple and light tool to create a marketplace for a small organization, university or some other group.

To install, you will need a MySQL database.
Restore it with schema.sql file. That should work, but if it doesn't.... we're terribly sorry :D

Then, edit database details in config.php file.
After that, you should have a running website ;)

Only buy-it-now type of functionality is implemented now. Auctions are to be possibly developed later.
Also, please take a look at mailing functions - it's not nice if we all use my server to send them :D

It doesn't deserve (or need) a Web Award or something.
It's just a small project we made for the course and hope someone else can find a use of it :)
Enjoy!
